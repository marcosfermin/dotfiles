If `git` is already installed:

```
git clone https://github.com/marcosfermin/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

If `git` is not installed:

1. Download ZIP of repo
2. Navigate to new `dotfiles` directory
3. Make `setup.sh` executable:

```
chmod +x setup.sh
```

4. Run `setup.sh`:

```
./setup.sh
```
